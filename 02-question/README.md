# Problem statement

We need to write code that will query the **meta data** of an instance within **AWS/Azure/GCP** and provide a JSON formatted output. The choice of language and implementation is up to you.

Bonus Points
The code allows for a particular data key to be retrieved individually

# Approach


AWS is widely used by many enterprises for **IAAS**. There are two API's IMDSv1 and IMDSv2, I am going to use IMDSv1 for this challenge IMDSv2 there is a new requirement to pass a
>**X-aws-ec2-metadata-token** and **X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds**


>The IMDS service of AWS, Azure and GCP are simple rest API's and can be implemented in wide range of programming languages. I have chosen Python to showcase my proficiency in Python


  The AWS IMDSv1 has an API

>http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/

The first call will return the top level Keys and we need to iterate the list of keys with the same API with the key amended at the end. Some of the keys may return another array of keys.

>http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/{key}

Finally we need to keep track all the keys and the values and build the JSON Object.

To obtain a value for a single key we still might need to retrieve  the entire meta-data and traverse through the JSON tree to find the value for the given key.  For further info refer to [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-retrieval.html)

In **Azure** it is fairly easy to retrieve meta data information. On a linux terminal
>curl -H Metadata:true --noproxy "*"  "http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance?api-version=2020-09-01"

Would give the JSON output of metadata


In **GCP** it is again similar to the AWS the first request will return a directory and the users have to make further calls to the api to get the values.

>curl "http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/" -H "Metadata-Flavor: Google"



# Assumptions





- The machine that is running this service is configured with right access keys and permissions in IAM.





# Testing





I am going to use Mocha javascript testing framework to do the unit testing





# Bonus Points



The code allows for a particular data key to be retrieved individually





# Prerequisites





Create an EC2 Linux instance on AWS



SSH into the instance





# Installation





Install Python 3 and git on your instance



>sudo yum install python3 git



Clone this repository



>git clone https://github.com/senthilkm/challenges




Install pipenv



>sudo pip3 install pipenv



Go to directory **challenge2**



>cd challenge2



Install project dependancies



>pipenv install





# Running





Open the src folder



>cd challenges/challenge2/src



Run whichever script you need:



>python3 metadata.py



>python3 querymetadata.py





Examples for the key ami-id or vpc-id
